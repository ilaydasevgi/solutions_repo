Theoretical Foundation The equation governing the motion of a forced damped pendulum is given by: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\gamma \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\omega_0^2 \\sin(\\theta) = A \\cos(\\omega t) \\] where: - \\(\\theta\\) is the angular displacement, - \\(\\gamma\\) is the damping coefficient, - \\(\\omega_0\\) is the natural frequency ( \\(\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{g/L}\\) for a simple pendulum), - \\(A\\) is the amplitude of the external driving force, - \\(\\omega\\) is the frequency of the external driving force. For small angles ( \\(\\theta \\approx \\sin \\theta\\) ), the equation simplifies to a linear differential equation: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\gamma \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\omega_0^2 \\theta = A \\cos(\\omega t) \\] The general solution consists of a homogeneous part (damped oscillation) and a particular part (forced oscillation). When the driving frequency approaches the natural frequency ( \\(\\omega \\approx \\omega_0\\) ), resonance occurs, leading to large oscillations. 2. Analysis of Dynamics We analyze the system by varying: - Damping coefficient ( \\(\\gamma\\) ) - Driving force amplitude ( \\(A\\) ) - Driving frequency ( \\(\\omega\\) ) Numerical Solution Using Python We use the Runge-Kutta method to solve the system numerically and visualize its dynamics. import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp # Define the equations of motion def forced_damped_pendulum(t, y, gamma, omega0, A, omega): theta, omega_theta = y dtheta_dt = omega_theta domega_dt = -gamma * omega_theta - omega0**2 * np.sin(theta) + A * np.cos(omega * t) return [dtheta_dt, domega_dt] # Parameters gamma = 0.5 # Damping coefficient omega0 = 1.0 # Natural frequency A = 1.2 # Driving force amplitude omega = 2.0 # Driving frequency # Initial conditions tspan = [0, 50] # Time span y0 = [0.2, 0] # Initial angle and angular velocity # Solve the ODE sol = solve_ivp(forced_damped_pendulum, tspan, y0, args=(gamma, omega0, A, omega), t_eval=np.linspace(0, 50, 1000)) # Plot results plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5)) plt.plot(sol.t, sol.y[0], label=\"Theta (Angle)\") plt.xlabel(\"Time\") plt.ylabel(\"Theta (rad)\") plt.title(\"Forced Damped Pendulum Motion\") plt.legend() plt.grid() plt.show() 3.
