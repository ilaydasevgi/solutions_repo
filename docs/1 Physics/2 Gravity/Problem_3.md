##  Motivation

When a payload is released from a moving rocket near Earth, it can follow a wide range of trajectories based on its **initial speed, direction, and altitude**. These can include:

- Reentry into Earth’s atmosphere,
- Stable orbits (elliptical or circular),
- Escape into space.

Understanding these trajectories is crucial for:

- Satellite deployment,
- Reentry planning,
- Interplanetary missions.

This problem blends **orbital mechanics** with **numerical simulation**, providing practical insight into real-world space mission planning.

### Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation

The gravitational force acting on a payload is:

$$
\vec{F} = -\frac{GMm}{r^2} \hat{r}
$$

Where:

- \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3/\text{kg} \cdot \text{s}^2 \) is the gravitational constant,
- \( M = 5.972 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} \) is Earth’s mass,
- \( m \) is the mass of the payload (cancels out later),
- \( r \) is the distance between Earth’s center and the payload,
- \( \hat{r} \) is the unit vector pointing toward Earth’s center.

Using Newton’s Second Law:

$$
\vec{a} = \frac{\vec{F}}{m} = -\frac{GM}{r^2} \hat{r}
$$

This gives us the acceleration at any point, which we use for simulation.

##  Orbital Energy and Trajectories

Total specific mechanical energy of the payload:

$$
\epsilon = \frac{v^2}{2} - \frac{GM}{r}
$$

- \( \epsilon < 0 \): Elliptical orbit (bound)
- \( \epsilon = 0 \): Parabolic trajectory (escape)
- \( \epsilon > 0 \): Hyperbolic trajectory (escape)

Escape velocity at distance \( r \):

$$
v_{\text{esc}} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}
$$

Escape velocity decreases with altitude since gravitational pull weakens. It is given by:

$$
v_{\text{esc}} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}
$$

Below is a plot showing how escape velocity changes with altitude:

##  Numerical Simulation (Euler Method)

We use the **Euler method** to simulate the motion of the payload. It updates position and velocity step-by-step using:

$$
\vec{v}_{n+1} = \vec{v}_n + \vec{a}_n \cdot \Delta t
$$

$$
\vec{r}_{n+1} = \vec{r}_n + \vec{v}_{n+1} \cdot \Delta t
$$

### Assumptions:

- Earth is a point mass at origin.
- Motion is in 2D space (x, y).
- Only gravity affects the payload (no atmosphere, drag, etc.).
