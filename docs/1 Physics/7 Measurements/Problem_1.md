# Problem 1
# Measuring Earth's Gravitational Acceleration with a Pendulum

---

## Motivation

The acceleration due to gravity \( g \) is a fundamental constant of nature, affecting a wide range of physical phenomena, from falling objects to satellite orbits. Determining \( g \) experimentally allows us to connect theoretical physics to measurable reality.

One of the most elegant and classical ways to measure \( g \) is with a **simple pendulum**, where the period of oscillation is directly related to the local gravitational field strength.

---

## Task

Use a simple pendulum to estimate the gravitational acceleration \( g \). Carefully measure time, length, and calculate uncertainties. Analyze the precision of your estimate and reflect on sources of error.

---

## Materials

- A string (approximately 1–1.5 meters in length)  
- A small mass (e.g., keychain, metal weight, bag of sugar)  
- A stopwatch (or a smartphone timer)  
- A ruler or measuring tape  

---

## Procedure

### 1. Setup

- Attach the string to a fixed support and tie the mass to the other end.  
- Measure the **length \( L \)** from the suspension point to the center of the mass.  
- Record the **ruler resolution**, then calculate the uncertainty in length as:  

$$
\Delta L = \frac{\text{Ruler Resolution}}{2}
$$

### 2. Data Collection

- Displace the pendulum by a small angle (less than \(15^\circ\)) and release.  
- Measure the time for **10 complete oscillations** (denoted \( T_{10} \)).  
- Repeat this process **10 times**, and record all measurements.  
- Calculate the **mean time** \( \overline{T}_{10} \) and the **standard deviation** \( \sigma_T \).  
- Estimate the **uncertainty** in the mean using:

$$
\Delta T_{10} = \frac{\sigma_T}{\sqrt{n}} \quad \text{where } n = 10
$$

## Calculations

### 1. Calculate the Period

The period \( T \) of one oscillation is:

$$
T = \frac{\overline{T}_{10}}{10}
$$

And its uncertainty:

$$
\Delta T = \frac{\Delta T_{10}}{10}
$$

---

### 2. Calculate Gravitational Acceleration

The formula for gravitational acceleration using a pendulum is:

$$
g = \frac{4\pi^2 L}{T^2}
$$

---

### 3. Propagate Uncertainties

The uncertainty in \( g \) is calculated using propagation of uncertainty:

$$
\Delta g = g \cdot \sqrt{
    \left( \frac{\Delta L}{L} \right)^2 +
    \left( 2 \cdot \frac{\Delta T}{T} \right)^2
}
$$

## Example Table (Fill with Your Data)

| Trial | \( T_{10} \) (s) |
|-------|------------------|
| 1     |                  |
| 2     |                  |
| ...   |                  |
| 10    |                  |

- Mean \( \overline{T}_{10} \) = ...  
- Standard deviation \( \sigma_T \) = ...  
- \( T = \overline{T}_{10} / 10 \) = ...  
- \( L = \) ... m ± \( \Delta L = \) ... m  
- \( g = \) ... m/s² ± \( \Delta g = \) ...

---

## Analysis

### 1. Comparison

Compare your measured value of \( g \) with the standard value:

$$
g_{\text{standard}} = 9.81 \ \text{m/s}^2
$$

### 2. Discussion

- How does **length resolution** (i.e., \( \Delta L \)) affect the uncertainty in \( g \)?  
- How does **timing variability** (i.e., \( \Delta T \)) contribute to your final result?  
- What sources of **systematic** or **random** error could influence your measurements?

---

## Deliverables

- Table of all \( T_{10} \) trials, length \( L \), and uncertainties  
- Calculated values: \( \overline{T}_{10} \), \( T \), \( g \), \( \Delta g \)  
- Discussion on uncertainties and comparison to the expected value

---

## Additional Notes

- Small angles (< \(15^\circ\)) are important to ensure the pendulum behaves like a **simple harmonic oscillator**.  
- Repeating measurements reduces **random error**.  
- The accuracy of your stopwatch and human reaction time are key contributors to the **total uncertainty**.
